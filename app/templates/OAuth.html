<p>Canvas Apps need to provide an OAuth path for users to authenticate the app and get an access token for querying with Salesforce. Even if the Canvas app's access method is the Signed Request(like this one), an org has the option to have admins pre-authorize the app for certain profiles, or allow users to self-authourize. If the self-authorize option is chosen, then an OAuth path needs to be provided for the user. To test the OAuth path, make sure the app is set to allow users to self authorize (setup/Managed Apps/Connected Apps), and click re-authorize below.</p>
