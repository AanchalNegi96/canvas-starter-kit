<h2 class="sub-title">Canvas App Starter Kit</h2>
<p>This kit is designed for Javascript developers (like us) who have an existing web application and would like to bring it to the Salesforce ecosphere. Canvas allows you to present your app(s) within the Salesforce domain and interact with Salesforce data, providing a seamless experience for your customers. Canvas apps can be the primary component of a Managed Package, allowing you to present your app on the Salesforce AppExchange. We have just completed bringing our <span><a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000000qp64EAA" target="_blank">DayBack</a></span> application to the AppExchange, and this kit is a close approximation of the approach we took. This kit draws heavily on the <a href="https://resources.docs.salesforce.com/sfdc/pdf/canvas_framework.pdf" target="_blank">Salesforce Documentation for Canvas</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceCanvasJavascriptSDK" target="_blank">Javascript Canvas SDK</a>, which is included. We recommend becoming familar with both of these resources when working with this kit.</p>
<h2 class="sub-title">Using This Kit</h2>
<p>This kit is built using <span><a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular.js</a></span>, and includes angular.js and ng-route.js,and should be a good starting point for Angular developers. Building on top of it, for non-angular folks, should not cause any issues. The critical parts of this kit do not require Angular, and you can just include the canvas-starter.js and canvas-all.js files to take full advantage of this kit. The canvas-all.js file is the primary component of Salesforce's Javascript SDK. The canvas-starter.js file is our example file, and should be a great starting point for your app's functions, and taking advantage of the SDK.</p>
<h2 class="sub-title">Installing this kit</h2>
<p>You can get install instructions, and download or fork the kit, from GitHub <span><a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">here</a></span>. The kit contains a template for your web app, and the Package components we use in DayBack.</p>
